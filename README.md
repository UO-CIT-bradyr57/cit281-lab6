# Lab 6

## Purpose:
The purpose of this lab was to create a class with properties as they relate to books. Given this class, I could add and delete the books from an array with a delete book method. 

## Technologies Learned:
```markdown
- GitHub
- classes
  - delete method
```
## What I learned:
I learned how to create different classes with properties. Building off of the classes, I was able to use different methods to manipulate properties in the array.
